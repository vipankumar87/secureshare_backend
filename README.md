# Project Name

This project is built using **Rust** and **SQLx** for database interactions. Below you'll find instructions on how to set up and manage the database, along with some key information about the tools used.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below to set up your environment and database.

### Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Ensure that you have Rust installed on your machine. You can install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
  
  ```bash
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
SQLx: This project uses SQLx for asynchronous database access in Rust. Make sure to have it installed by adding it to your Cargo.toml with the required features.

toml
Copy code
[dependencies]
sqlx = { version = "0.5", features = ["postgres", "runtime-tokio-native-tls"] }
PostgreSQL: Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your machine.

Running the Project
Install dependencies

Run the following command to install all dependencies required for the project:

bash
Copy code
$ ./deps.sh
Set up the database

To initialize the database, use the following commands:

Add migration files for database tables:

bash
Copy code
$ sqlx migrate add tables
Create the database:

bash
Copy code
$ sqlx database create
Run the migrations:

bash
Copy code
$ sqlx migrate run
Rust Overview
Rust is a systems programming language focused on speed, memory safety, and concurrency. Here are a few key features of Rust that are leveraged in this project:

Memory Safety: Rust’s ownership model ensures that you don’t run into issues like dangling pointers or data races, making it a safe choice for multi-threaded environments.
Concurrency: Rust provides concurrency with thread safety, making it efficient for applications where performance and safety are paramount.
Async Programming: Rust’s async capabilities (via async and await) are used in conjunction with SQLx to handle database connections efficiently.
SQLx Overview
SQLx is a Rust library that provides compile-time checked queries and is asynchronous by nature. Here's why SQLx is a great choice for database interactions:

Compile-time Safety: SQLx validates your SQL queries at compile time, preventing runtime errors related to SQL.
Async: It's built with async/await in mind, ensuring non-blocking database operations, which is crucial for performance in web applications.
Support for Multiple Databases: SQLx supports various databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite. In this project, we use PostgreSQL.
